API->>User: HTTP Response 
API->>SQLite: CRUD Request
SQLite->>API: CRUD Response
```

## Endpoints
All endpoints begin with the prefix `/api`. 

### Unauthenticated Endpoints
`GET /register`
Returns an API key which can be used for authenticated endpoints.
##### Response
```json
{
    "apikey": "key=="
}
```
### Authenticated Endpoints
Authentication is expected to be an `API key` passed in by the `Authorization` http header.
